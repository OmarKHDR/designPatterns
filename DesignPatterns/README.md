# DESIGN PATTERNS
it's a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

design patterns improves:
- reusability 
- flexibility
- maintainability
- scalability
- performance
- security
- testability

## Types of Design Patterns
1. Creational Design Patterns
- it's all about class instantiation or object creation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.
2. Structural Design Patterns
- it's all about class and object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
3. Behavioral Design Patterns
- it's all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.
